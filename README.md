This project was initially meant to be a Fitness level up game to motivate myself to get in shape. However, while making AI personalities for rival fitness characters, I got a little carried away and simulated an entire civilization of evolving ideas and prompting.

This project is a work in progress.
Right now it is quite basic, and just simulates evolutionary prompting that encoruages pure attacking and no messaging.
My next steps are to simulate various other forms of civilization that encourage deeper thinking, communication, and social deception.
